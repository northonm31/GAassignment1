Git and Git Hub Questions:
--------------------------

1. What is the equivalent git command for when you press the Git Hub app "Sync" button?
git pull


2. What is the command for seeing the repository history via the command line?
git log


3. In the Git Hub app, I can "discard changes" to a file by right clicking on it. What's the equivalent command on the terminal?
git ignore


4. What does a "pull request" actually do?
“git pull” combines the “git fetch” and “git merge” commands; meaning that it will pull down data from a repository you don’t yet have in your local repository including the history of changes and any branches, and it will then merge any changes within the remote files into your local ones.


5. What does a .gitignore file do? 
A .gitignore file specifies files you have explicitly told git to ignore for staging and commits.


6. Why is a .gitignore file useful?
A .gitignore file is useful for allowing developers to progress on a project that is not yet at a point that is ready for sharing with others/pushing to a repo. It is also useful for saving time and eliminating confusion by allowing the user to not have to perform a “git status” command every time before pushing to check for unwanted files.


7. What is "Open Source" software?
Open Source software is transparently developed, universally shared software with a free license intended to be improved and built-upon by the wider development community, to then be shared again.


8. How can "Open Source" software help me with my final project?
Due to the fact that I’m trying to learn a whole new coding language, and how to integrate various APIs in a 12 week period; finding open source solutions will allow me to see how others have accomplished similar tasks in the past.
